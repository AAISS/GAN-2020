# Generative Adversarial Networks Workshop


[AAISS2020](http://aaiss.ceit.aut.ac.ir/)

This workshop had two instructors with two level.  

The first part (basic) was taught by Mohammad Rahmdel:  
- Basic Introduction to Generative Adversarial networks- GAN  
- Implementation of the main article of Generative Adversarial networks from A to Z with tensorflow2 and step-by-step explanations.  
- Learn to model with several different datasets and display outputs.  
- Further explanations, tips and review of the training process (review of outputs, cost function, Convergence and ...)  
- Preliminary review of other applications of Generative Adversarial Networks  

and the second part (advance) was taught by Vahid Reza Khazaie:  
- GAN
- DCGAN
- Context Encoders
- pix2pix
- CycleGAN
