- Implementation of the main article of Generative Adversarial networks from A to Z with tensorflow2 and step-by-step explanations.  
- Learn to model with several different datasets and display outputs.  
- Further explanations, tips and review of the training process (review of outputs, cost function, Convergence and ...)  
- Preliminary review of other applications of Generative Adversarial Networks  
and the next part is held by Mr.Khazaie and its syllabus is as follows:
